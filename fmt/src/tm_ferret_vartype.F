* Given a netCDF variable type return the corresponding Ferret parameter

* V533 *sh* 6/01
* V540 *acm* per SH email of 10/19/01  For datasets with datatype "short"
*            Ferret translates the "short" to "float" but the new code 
*            made it think that the variable is, indeed, of type short.
* V65  *acm* 1/10  Change all netcdf2-style calls and parameter names to 
*                  netcdf3-style calls, which are also consistent with netcdf4.
* V6.74  3/12 *acm* cleanup ifdefs and unnecessary include files
* V7.44 11/18 *acm* Issue 1905: add int64 as a netcdf data type, recognize 
*                   other newer types

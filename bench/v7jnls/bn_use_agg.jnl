! The syntax "use myagg.agg" runs Ferret commands in the journal file myagg.agg
! which initialize an aggregation dataset, treating .agg file as a dataset.
! as of 5/20/18, the .agg extension is not needed (issue 1651)

! The .agg file in a directory with path spelled out, but w/o the .agg extension

! Assumes the current working directory is the bench subdirectory
define symbol pwd `SPAWN("pwd")`
use  ($pwd)/v7jnls/four
show data
can data/all

! .agg file found in directory in the FER_GO paths

use four.agg

show data
can data/all

! found in a directory in the FER_GO paths, w/o extension
use four
show data
can data/all


! The more complex example from bn_aggregate_u, aggregate in U, T, E, F.

! If aggregate_tef script has already run, leaving the example files 
! it writes in aggtef/, reuse those, otherwise create them.

! check for those files.

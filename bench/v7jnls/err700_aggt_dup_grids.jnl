! Bug 2507: new time axis is identical in two tseries aggregation.
!  It exists in more than one grid. Previously the new time axis
!  was swapped into only one of the grids for the second aggregation.

! Define some datsets, with two variables with different grids each 
! using a common time axis.

use  aggt/tagg_irreg_1.nc
define axis/x=1:1:1 xax1
let newvar = x[gx=xax1] + myvar
save/clobber/file=a1.nc myvar, newvar
can dat/all
use  aggt/tagg_irreg_2.nc
save/clobber/file=a2.nc myvar, newvar

can dat/all; can var/all

! Define two aggregations; the second should share the time axis
! that was set up in the first.
sp ln -sf a1.nc b1.nc
sp ln -sf a2.nc b2.nc

tseries a2var = a1.nc, a2.nc
tseries b2var = b1.nc, b2.nc

! previously the time axis of the second variable in b2var was 
! listed as length 10
sh dat
